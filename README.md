This is a simple React Todo app using TypeScript. Users can add tasks by typing in an input field and clicking the "Add todo" button. Each task has a unique ID, title, and a status (default: "Not Done"). The tasks are displayed in a list, showing their title and status. The app uses `useState` to manage the todo list and input text.
